    "Creating a project\n",
    "\n",
    "Three main projects are important\n",
    "=> ASP.NET Core Application Type Web API => API\n",
    "=> Class Library => Application\n",
    "=> Class Library => Contracts Project => Allows sincyng between apis\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows reusable code\n",
    "\n",
    "API => uses both layers\n",
    "Application does not know of the contracts and the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations are basic CRUD\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start working on contracts\n",
    "=> Two Folders Requests and Responses\n",
    "   => Naming conventions XXXXRequest XXXXResponse\n",
    "   => use properties with required and {get; init;} => does not allow changes during runtime\n",
    "   => use one class for Create, Update => Better option to allow scalability, do not use the same contract\n",
    "   => use IEnumerable is favored\n",
    "   => Requests and responses can have similar structures\n",
    "   => Collections should be defined with a property inside called items\n",
    "\n",
    "Create in memory database\n",
    "=> Repository Pattern\n",
    "=> class Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Place interfaces inside and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Create models folder => this can have {get; set;} => List etc.\n",
    "=> Create the IRepostiory => where create , getbyId, getall, update, delete\n",
    "=> this then can be implemented in a class => start with a memory\n",
    "   => private readonly List with the implementation itself\n",
    "=> Use tasks to allow future implementations which most database use\n",
    "=> This will be injected and needs to be registered in the Program\n",
    "   builder.Services.AddSingleton<IInterface, IInterface> => Not a good way\n",
    "   create an extensions ApplicationServiceCollectionExtensions => AddApplication\n",
    "   => then add the services\n",
    "   => this is done in order for the API to not know about the application which is a good practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets advance to the controller\n",
    "=> Create one Controller => Attribute [ApiController] and base ControllerBase\n",
    "=> inject the service itself\n",
    "=> Start Creating Route to introduce api\n",
    "=> use Task<IActionResult> as preferable for Post\n",
    "=> use attribute [FromBody] CreateMovieRequest request\n",
    "=> use attribute [HttpPost(route)] with the route\n",
    "=>  the response should provide a Response class with the apropriate response and Created when its created\n",
    "  => should also provide the Get Request that can be used to obtain the created object\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Mapping\n",
    "=> Common in APIs and ASPNet\n",
    "=> There are multiple libraries but mapping should be easy\n",
    "=> Create a Folder Mapping and a ContractMapping class to represent the extensions that perform the mapping\n",
    "=> Way better coding => avoid using automapper\n",
    "=> Do not put business logic in mappers\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping track of endpoints\n",
    "=> Make a central location usually named ApiEndpoints\n",
    "=> create a private const to represent the base and create partial classes for each controller\n",
    "=> this allows for better mapping of endpoints\n",
    "=> Avoids out of sync problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the process is\n",
    "Create an endpoint on ApiEndpoints\n",
    "using {{id}} => allows route parameters to be used\n",
    "using {{id:guid}} => allows route parameters that need to be a guid\n",
    "[FromRoute] can be used to obtain parameters from the route itself\n",
    "NotFound => Represents a code that can be used when no item was found\n",
    "Ok => should provide a response and not the object directly\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve\n",
    "=> use CreatedAtAction allows for better results for the client\n",
    "   => provides a header with the location fully represented avoiding concatenations\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing Update Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing Delete Method\n",
    "\n",
    "CRUD is performed\n",
    "=> Create, Return, Update, Delete\n",
    "\n",
    "Patch => Used for Partial Update\n",
    "      => Total Updates are easy\n",
    "      => Complicated to mutate needs to be generic enough to work and not worth it\n"
